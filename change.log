			is released from the "missle silo
			- durning the mission things went wrong, they found out we were behind their army's line
			and the missle test was started me and the platoon managed to break thru china's defences
			and stop the missle from acheiving lauch status, however the missle was left suspended above its hangar in the ground
			Rob and Cole stayed behind to disarm the missle while me and Kozy left to defend them against incoming chinamen
			while defending our position Kozy was shot in the stomach and we had to evacuate. I radio'ed the situation in to 
			and the missle exlpoded on the ground
