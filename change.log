	STORYLINE PSEUDO:
	-Premase:
		- Swat member sent into North Korea on overt mission
			- my squad was choosen at complete random beceause after russian intervienved in the 20??
			election, they sold the U.S information to china, including the militaries soilder list and strategic plans,
			to support them in their battles against the United states.
			- My platoons goals are to intercept the nuclear missle testing plans and to stop the initial test launch before the missile
			is released from the "missle holding compartment" and reaches its destination for this will only result in assurance to china
			that they can further be a threat to the U.S and the world.
			- durning the mission things went wrong, they found out we were behind their army's line
			and the missle test was started me and the platoon managed to break thru china's defences
			and stop the missle from acheiving lauch status, however the missle was left suspended above its hangar in the ground
			Rob and Cole stayed behind to disarm the missle while me and Kozy left to defend them against incoming chinamen
			while defending our position Kozy was shot in the stomach and we had to evacuate. I radio'ed the situation in to 
			and the missle exlpoded on the ground
